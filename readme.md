# SpaceX Launches

This project will be the re-build of Space-X missions launches from my project exam of Javascript/CSS/HTML. The purpose of this repository will be to organize the codes properly, splitting them up into modules and make the project more readable for the future. Showcase of the project will be to improve the codes and folder structure of [Space-X Missions](https://github.com/ToppHestmark/spacex-missions), back then I were inexperience and didn't know how to make the project scale. The CSS has been organized by [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), and I tried to make the folder structure as industry standard as possible.

Some improvement to be made:

- [ ] Project folder structure and set-up.
- [ ] Styles according to the SASS recommendations/rules.
- [ ] Splitting up the codes into smaller modules.
- [ ] Less repeating codes, apply DRY principle.
